# machineLearning_SVM_XOR_andProblem

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. Most often SVM is used for classification. The objective of SVM is to find the most optimal way to separate data according to the defined outputs. SVM does this by identifying the support vectors of the data set. This creates the hyperplane that separate the classes of data. 

The current assignment is broken into two parts:

Part 1 of the assignment required using SVM for the XOR problem. XOR is a logical operation that returns a true output if one of the input values is true and the other is false. XOR is considered a classification problem since the expected outputs are known in advance. 

Part 2 of the assignment required expanding the ideas from the XOR problem to new problems. This section requires changing the XOR problem to an AND problem using SVM. In contrast to XOR, the AND logical operator returns a true output only when both inputs values are true.
